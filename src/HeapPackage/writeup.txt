This assignment was easy, just follow the formula below... Took about 15 mins.

Write a static method that accepts an array of ints and a value k. It should have a
signature like this:

public static int kthSmallest(int[] a, int k)

The method should return the kth smallest value in the array:
If k i= 1: return the smallest element in the array
If k = 2: return the second smallest element in the array
If k = 9: return the ninth smallest element in the array
etc.

The value of k must be greater than or equal to 1, and it must be less than or
equal to the length of the array. Otherwise throw an IllegalArgumentException.

Your method should work in the following way:
1. Begin by creating a MaxHeap
2., Next add k elements from the parameter array into the MaxHeap. These start out
as your k smallest elements.
3. For each of the remaining elements in the array
4. Compare the element to the top of the heap.
5. If it is smaller, remove the old max, and add the new element
6. When you have made your way through the whole parameter array then the top of
the heap is the kth smallest element.

Write a main method that tests your kthSmallest method on three different arrays.
